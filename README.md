# Depth First Search (DFS) Algorithm

## Algorithm Steps
* Select the start node.
* Visit the start node.
* Explore the neighbors of the start node.
* If there are undiscovered neighbor nodes, switch to that node and repeat the steps recursively.
* When there are no undiscovered neighbor nodes, go back and return to the previous node.
* Repeat the steps until all nodes have been visited.
